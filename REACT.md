##### What I had used

- [To Do Application Tutorial](https://github.com/kabirbaidhya/react-todo-app)
  
  This is for people who don't like watching videos or reading long explanations and like to see some code immediately and like to understand from that itself.

  This GitHub tutorial is accompanied by these short and concise slides interspersed with memes :)) I'm sure Ug2k19 will like it given their obsession with the meme culture. [Slides are here!](https://speakerdeck.com/kabirbaidhya/frontend-development-with-react)

- [Weather Application](https://github.com/ericvicenti/intro-to-react) 

  Another GitHub tutorial for a weather application, very beginner friendly.
